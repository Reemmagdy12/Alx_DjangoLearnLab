This is my django project
In this project I added some permissions on the Book model like can_create,can _edit and can_delete 
And then I added these permissions on some of the views after assigning them to the grpups :
Viewers have only can_view permission
Editors have can_view, can_create and can_edit permissions 
Admins have can_view, can_create, can_edit and can_delete permissions
